# AledLang

AledLang is a stupid programming language, this repo contains what
is *- I hope -* the only tool to compile and debug it.

This language is so difficult to use that programming an AledLang
interpertor is simpler than making a hello world with it... Aled is
the contraction of "Ã  l'aide" in French which means "help" / "help me".

Originally, it is interpreted but a compiler for x86 in 32bit is now
functional (it generates GNU assembly files and not directly .elf files).

## Syntax

The language was designed to be written on a single line, the number,
keyword and operator must be separated by any non-null quantity of any
whitespace.

### Pushs

The language is stack based, each written number is pushed into the stack,
we can also note charaters which will send their ascii value.

```
[ PUSHING NUMBERS ]

> 1 2 3 'A'

- 1 is pushed
- 2 is pushed
- 3 is pushed
- 65 is pushed (A ascii value)
```

To simplify the push of string, we can note a sequence of charatere between
double quote, which will push all the chars of the string with a \0 at the end.

```
[ PUSHING STRING ]

> "Hello"

- 72 is pushed (H ascii value)
- 101 is pushed (e ascii value)
- 108 is pushed (l ascii value)
- 108 is pushed (l ascii value)
- 111 is pushed (o ascii value)
- 0 is pushed (NULL terminator)
```

### Stack

The stack is a LIFO stack, the last element pushed is the first to be popped.
Numbers pushed are 32bits integers.

```
[ PRINT 42 AND 123 ]

> 123 42 PRINT PRINT

- 123 is pushed
- 42 is pushed
- 42 is popped and printed
- 123 is popped and printed
```

### Labels

A label is a number surrounded by parenthesis, it is used to represent a
position in the code, it is used by the `GOTO` and `JIF` keywords.

```
[ PRINT 123 UNTIL THE END OF TIME ]

> (0) 123 PRINT 0 GOTO

- 123 is pushed
- 123 is popped and printed
- 0 is pushed
- 0 is popped and the program jumps to the label 0
```

### Comments

comments are not recommended because they risk making the code less obscure,
however I am easily influenced and a friend asked me to implement them.

```
[ PRINT 42 WITH TOO MANY COMMENTS ]

> 42 [gosh, I love comments] PRINT // I love them so much

- 42 is pushed
- 42 is popped and printed
```
